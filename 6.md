# Hazel: A Frontend Exploration of Datomic Principles

Hazel is a proof of concept investigating how [Datomic](https://www.datomic.com/) principles can be adapted for frontend environments. This project introduces a JavaScript peer library capable of navigating a [DataScript](https://github.com/tonsky/datascript/) database and seamlessly storing its segments within the browser's cache.

## Motivation

In an era where productivity tools like Asana, Jira, Slack, and Notion handle increasingly large datasets directly in the browser, Hazel seeks to empower these applications with the ability to execute fast queries independent of backend access. Built upon the React TodoMVC framework, Hazel provides a strategic approach to engaging with databases efficiently.

## Core Features

- **Lazy Data Fetching**: Dynamically load database segments from the backend as needed, minimizing unnecessary data transfer.
- **Browser-Based Persistence**: Store database segments long-term in the browser cache, facilitating quick access and retrieval.
- **Consistent Snapshots**: Obtain reliable and consistent views of the database without backend dependency.

## Architecture

Hazel operates by interacting with DataScript database storage segments, produced during transaction handling. The database utilizes three covering indices: EAV, AEV, and AVE, structured as persistent B+ trees. Hazel leverages these indices for efficient querying:

- **Branch Nodes**: Organize keys and node addresses for efficient tree navigation.
- **Leaf Nodes**: Maintain ordered sequences of datoms, essential for effective data retrieval.

### Understanding the Data Model

Hazel's design is rooted in Datomic and DataScript's datom structure, a triad of entity, attribute, and value (E, A, V). Although missing the Transaction ID (T) component found in these databases, Hazel ensures seamless integration by focusing on essential data interactions.

For a thorough understanding of these principles, refer to the [Datomic Introduction](https://docs.datomic.com/datomic-overview.html).

## Benefits and Value Proposition

Hazel facilitates the execution of sophisticated, asynchronous queries directly within browser environments, maintaining functionality even in offline scenarios. Developers can appreciate the value of operating within a local context, akin to a Datomic-like environment, ultimately improving user experiences by reducing latency and enhancing data interactivity.

## Limitations

While Hazel provides foundational operations such as `(r)seek` and `datoms` over indices, it currently faces challenges in access control. Proposed solutions include:

- **Backend Query API**: Introduce an API to handle restricted queries backend-side, though it might compromise the caching advantage.
- **Task Data Distribution**: Spread tasks across multiple project-specific databases to regulate access.

## Future Work

Further enhancements could include implementing [Datalog](https://docs.datomic.com/query/query-executing.html) capabilities and supporting Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) for an advanced local-first paradigm.

## Getting Started

Run Hazel using Docker:

```bash
docker build -t hazel . && docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 hazel
```

Access the application at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Development

Execute tests with:

```bash
bun run test
```

**Note**: The Bun builder is currently in beta and presents certain functional limitations:

- Changes in configuration via `build.js` trigger only script reloads, not the entire project.
- Auto-generation of `manifest.json` is pending implementation.

This revised README aims to inform and engage developers by providing coherent and precise documentation, justifying the use of Hazel while aligning with established data modeling techniques.
