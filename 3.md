# Hazel

Hazel is a proof-of-concept (POC) project that explores adapting [Datomic](https://www.datomic.com/) principles for the frontend environment. This JavaScript library provides a peer interface for navigating [DataScript](https://github.com/tonsky/datascript/) databases, offering efficient client-side data management by storing segments in the browser cache.

## Motivation

In modern web applications such as Asana, Jira, Slack, and Notion, it's crucial to manage substantial datasets directly in the browser without relying on frequent backend access. Hazel caters to this need by enabling rapid queries on these datasets, thereby enhancing the responsiveness and functionality of productivity tools.

## Core Features

- **Lazy Database Iteration:** Efficiently fetch and iterate over database segments on-demand, making use of asynchronous lazy loading techniques.
- **Local Storage Utilization:** Store database segments in the browser cache for long-term access, ensuring data persistence and quick retrieval.
- **Consistent Snapshots:** Provide reliable database snapshots, maintaining consistency and integrity across transactions.

## Architecture Overview

Hazel operates on the front end by interacting with DataScript database storage segments. The model is largely based on three core indices: EAV, AEV, and AVE, structured as a persistent B+ tree.

### Key Concepts

- **Datom Structure:** In DataScript, a datom is represented as a triplet `[EntityID, Attribute, Value] (E, A, V)`, excluding the Transaction ID (T) which Datomic typically incorporates. Hazel focuses on these core elements to streamline processing.
- **Persistent B+ Tree:** The database utilizes a B+ tree, with each node acting as a storage segment. This structure supports efficient data retrieval and storage operations.
- **Async Generators:** Utilize JavaScript's `AsyncGenerator` pattern for non-blocking, lazy sequence processing, akin to Clojure/Script's lazy collection handling.

## Benefits

Utilizing Hazel allows for substantial performance improvements in applications dealing with large datasets directly on the client-side. By caching data locally and processing queries within the application itself, developers can leverage a more efficient and responsive data handling method, aligning with the emerging local-first applications paradigm.

## Limitations

Currently, Hazel implements basic operations such as `seek` and `datoms` over indices. A notable challenge is access control, especially in scenarios like sharing data across collaborative projects (e.g., an Asana project). Potential solutions include:

1. Developing a supplementary backend API for controlled data access, though it may compromise caching benefits.
2. Distributing task data across multiple project-specific databases for finer access management.

## Future Work

- **Advanced Query Support:** Explore implementing datalog functionalities and extending existing Datomic/DataScript APIs.
- **Local-First Paradigm Adoption:** Investigate possibilities for integrating Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) via frontend-transactable JavaScript database functions for seamless offline-first experiences.

## Getting Started

To run Hazel locally, use Docker:

```bash
docker build -t hazel .
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 hazel
```

Visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

## Development

Currently using Bun (beta) for testing:

```bash
bun run test
```

*Note: Bun builder's beta features include limited build reloading and pending implementation of automatic `manifest.json` generation.*
