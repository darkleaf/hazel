# Hazel

Welcome to Hazel, a visionary proof of concept (POC) tailored to transpose [Datomic](https://www.datomic.com/) principles into the frontend realm. With Hazel, we introduce a peer JavaScript library adept at navigating a [DataScript](https://github.com/tonsky/datascript/) database, efficiently storing its segments in the browser cache. This innovation is particularly advantageous for productivity applications like Asana, Jira, Slack, and Notion, especially when managing substantial databases directly in the browser, necessitating rapid data queries without backend intervention.

Built upon the React TodoMVC framework, Hazel offers a suite of capabilities:

- **Lazy Database Iteration**: Fetch database segments from the backend on-demand, facilitating seamless transitions between data segments.
- **Persistent Browser Caching**: Store these segments long-term within the browser cache, ensuring data longevity and accessibility.
- **Consistent Database Snapshots**: Achieve stable and reliable snapshots of databases, crucial for maintaining data integrity.

## Core Motivations

The essence of Hazel lies in delivering robust data query capabilities at the client side. By utilizing Datomic-like systems, applications transition from basic key-value (KV) storage to comprehensive on-site data querying, harnessing the full power of the query engine within your application's cache. For an introduction to these paradigms, explore the [Datomic Introduction](https://docs.datomic.com/datomic-overview.html).

## Architectural Insights

In Hazel, familiarity with the DataScript or Datomic data model is instrumental. Key resources include the [Information Model](https://docs.datomic.com/datomic-overview.html#information-model) and [Indexes](https://docs.datomic.com/datomic-overview.html#indexes).

A DataScript database operates on the fundamental unit of a Datom, a triplet [Entity ID, Attribute, Value] (E, A, V) stored across three main indices: EAV, AEV, AVE. Hazel excludes the Transaction ID (T) component, unlike Datomic. These indices are structured as persistent B+ trees, each node serving as a storage segment within the browser.

Here's an exploration of Hazel's handling of storage segments and tails, providing an API akin to the low-level Datomic API:

- **seek-datoms**
- **datoms**

In Clojure/Script, these would return lazy collections. In JavaScript, we utilize Async Generators (`function*/yield`) to manage asynchronous and lazy operations, as nodes are fetched asynchronously over the network.

## Limitations and Considerations

Current implementations focus on the (r)seek and datoms methods across indices. Access control remains a challenge, particularly in collaborative settings such as Asana, where database caching in the browser could inadvertently expose data.

Potential solutions include:

- Developing an API to execute queries backend-side, enhancing access control albeit at the cost of caching benefits.
- Replicating task data across multiple project databases to manage collaborator access.

Feedback and discussions are welcome via issues in this repository.

## Future Directions

Scope for future enhancements encompasses implementing [datalog](https://docs.datomic.com/query/query-executing.html) and additional Datomic/DataScript APIs. Furthermore, embracing a local-first paradigm could enable the use of Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDT) through JavaScript-based database functions on the frontend.

## Quick Start

To run Hazel:

- `docker build -t hazel . && docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 hazel`
- Access the app at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## Development

Execute tests with:

```
bun run test
```

Note: Bun builder is currently in beta and lacks certain functionalities:

- Changes don't trigger `build.js` reloads, requiring manual handling for project files.
- Automatic `manifest.json` generation is yet to be supported.
